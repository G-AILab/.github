## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, we are the G-AILAB research group from Central South Unviersity. 

### Our Lab is focus the basic ML and AI algorithms for buiding interpretable industrial solutions.

Our major research focuses on the 

1) **interpretable** AI, we are the first to use DRL to understand the environment. 
2) **Feature selection**, identify the most related features for modeling, we are the first to use attention-based solutions for feature selection in tabular data.
3) **Graph Representation Learning**, represent complex relations in the graphs without label-guidance.
