## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, we are the G-AILAB research group from Central South Unviersity. 

### Our Lab is focus the basic ML and AI algorithms for buiding interpretable industrial solutions.

Our major research focuses on the 

1) **interpretable** AI, we are the first to use DRL to understand the environment, [DAFSFluid]<https://github.com/G-AILab/DAFSFluid> , accpeted by SIGKDD 2022
2) **Feature selection**, identify the most related features for modeling, we are the first to use attention-based solutions for feature selection in tabular data, AAAI 2019 [AFS]<https://github.com/G-AILab/AFS>, Recently, we proposed the use of self-supervision for semi-supervised feature selection. Source Code to appeared soon. 
3) **Graph Representation Learning**, represent complex relations in the graphs without label-guidance. Published in IEEE TKDE, [PairE] <https://github.com/G-AILab/PairE>
4) **Oulier Detection**, detects the ouliers from normal data, we study the case for tabular data and time series. Source code to be released. 
5) **Data Imputation**, fill missing data with self-supervised tasks. Source code to be released upon accptance.
